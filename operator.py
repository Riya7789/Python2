# operators
# Arithmetic,Assignment,Logical,Comparison,identity,membership,bitwise operators

#identity operator
# a=10;
# b=30;
# c=a;
# print(a is c)
# print(b is c)
# print(c is not a)
# print(b is a)
#
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(id(c))

#membership operator
# name='richa'
# print('i'in name)
# print('r' not in name)
# print('y' not in name)
# print('s'in name)


# users=['sophia','james','jane','joe']
# print('sophia'in users[0])
# print('hari' not in users[0])
# print('ram' not in users[0])

#bitwise operators works with binary number
#bitwise AND
# print(bin(5))
# print(bin(6))   binary form
# print(5&6)  ADDITION OF TWO BINARY NUMBERS
# print(bin(5&6))

# data=[
#     [1,2,3],
#     [4,5,6],
#     [7,8,9]
# ]
#check if 5 in list,10 and 7 not in list

# print(5 in data[1])
# # print(5 in data[1])
# # print(5 in data[2])
# print(10&7 not in data)

# a, *b = 10,20,30,40
# print(a)
# print(b)

# *a, b=10,20,30,40
# print(a)
# print(b)
